Simple Note 
This is a simple note-taking application built using React. Users can create, save, delete, and search notes. Additionally, there are some optional features such as dark mode and Markdown support.

Features
Note Creation: Users can create new notes by providing a title and content through a simple form.
Note Display: Notes are displayed as boxes containing titles and content.
Note Saving: Users can save their written notes, which become visible on the UI after saving.
Note Deletion: Each note box includes a delete button. Clicking it removes the corresponding note from the UI.
Note Searching: Users can search for specific notes using a search box. The search functionality filters notes in real-time based on the entered query.
Optional: Dark Mode: Implement a dark mode feature for users preferring a darker color scheme.
Optional: Markdown Support: Allow users to write notes using Markdown for enhanced text formatting.
Technical Considerations
React Components: Distinct React components are used for different sections, such as note form, note list, and search bar.
State Management: React state is utilized to manage dynamic content like notes and search queries.
Event Handling: Event handlers are implemented for actions like saving and deleting notes.
Local Storage: Local storage is used to persist user notes across page refreshes.
